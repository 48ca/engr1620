# ENGR 1620 Arduino Code
This is the code that will be used for controlling the LIDAR Lite v3 sensor.
It is intended to turn on an LED if a car is detected by the sensor.

## Editing and Uploading the Code
To upload the code to an Arduino, you need to first import Garmin's LIDAR Lite V3 library. Garmin distributes a ZIP file that you need to add to the Arduino IDE library manager.
Now, plug in the Arduino to your computer.
In the IDE, select the board you are targeting (Arduino Pro Mini), and select the programmer that is being used (this should be automatic).
Now you can upload the code, and you should see lights flash on the programmer while it is being uploaded.
